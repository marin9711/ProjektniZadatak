        <h2>Sony looks to electric cars for its next big hit</h2>
        <p class="description">Hotel booking sites are to be probed by the UK's competition watchdog to see if consumers are being misled by them.</p>
        <p>Jan 5 (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Group Corp (6758.T) plans to launch a company this spring to examine entering the electric vehicle market, looking to harness its strengths in entertainment and sensors to play a bigger role in next-generation mobility.</p>
        <p>The new company, Sony Mobility Inc, comes as the Japanese tech giant is "exploring a commercial launch" of electric vehicles, Sony chairman and president Kenichiro Yoshida told a news conference, speaking ahead of the CES technology trade fair in the United States.</p>
        <p>"With our imaging and sensing, cloud, 5G and entertainment technologies combined with our contents mastery, we believe Sony is well positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility," he said.</p>
        <p>Although its once-dominant position in consumer electronics has been eroded by Asian rivals like South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS), Sony still has an arsenal of sophisticated technology in areas such as sensors critical to autonomous driving.</p>
        <p>It also remains one of the world's biggest entertainment companies, home to prominent video game and movie franchises. Audio and entertainment systems are increasingly a focus for next-generation vehicles.</p>
