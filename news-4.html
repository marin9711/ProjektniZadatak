        <h2>Sony shows off SUV, will explore building electric cars as ‘Sony Mobility Inc’</h2>
        <p class="description">“There is suddenly a vibrant market that traditional manufacturers have been slow to tap into — but the window of opportunity is a narrow one and closing fast,” said one auto analyst.</p>
        <p>At CES in Las Vegas this evening, Sony’s Chairman, President and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida showed off a brand new prototype of its Vision S concept electric car, and announces that the Sony Group is starting a new division – the Sony Mobility Inc – which will start commercializing its electric vehicles.</p>
        <p>On the CES stage during the Sony press conference, the company showed off its existing Sony Vision-S sedan, which was revealed at CES last year. This year, it also flexed a new model in the line-up, the Sony Vision-S SUV prototype.</p>
        <p>“The excitement we received after we showed off the Vision-S really encouraged us to further consider how we can bring creativity and technology to change the experience of moving from one place to another,” said Yoshida, before revealing the new Vision S SUV prototype. “This is our new Vision-S SUV. Vision-S has been developed on a foundation of safety, adaptability and entertainment. Safety has been our number 1 priority in creating a comfortable mobility experience. That has not changed when building this SUV. A total of 40 sensors are installed inside and outside of the vehicle to monitor safety.</p>
