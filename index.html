		<h1>Electric cars in 2022 - What to expect?</h1>

		<p>The Lucid Air is an all-new electric car with up to 517 miles of range, up to 1080 horsepower, and a zero-to-60 time of as little as 2.5 seconds. The Air, for which pre-orders are currently available and is expected to see first customer deliveries in early 2021, can thus best the Tesla Model S, the dominant force in the electric vehicle (EV) world, on multiple objective metrics.</p>

		<p>“We worked really hard on aerodynamic optimization and airflow,” says Derek Jenkins, Lucid’s vice president of design. “Especially as it relates to air openings, because less air going through the car means less drag.” Lucid’s air management yields a lower drag than Tesla’s Model S, making the Air among the slickest luxury sedans on the market.</p>

		<p>The Air’s shape is also original. With a short hood, a huge cabin topped by a full glass roof, and a bubble-backed rear windshield, the car looks both practical and futuristic. Because there’s no engine up front, the cabin dimensions are stretched. So while the Air is, according to Jenkins, “smaller, lower, and narrower than Model S,” it has more cargo and passenger space. “Four Tesla Model S ‘frunks’ [front trunks] can fit in our frunk,” Jenkins says.</p>

		<p>Where the Model S’s interior design is very uncluttered, it has always struck us as bland and de-contented. The inside of the Air manages to look cool and futuristic but more attentively designed, with a 34-inch screen that runs across much of the dash and another screen down low in the center console where the occupants can more readily access and touch it. (There is a large hidden storage space behind this screen.) The Air also features deluxe and environmentally friendly materials such as vegan leather, recycled yarn, and alpaca wool upholstery, as well as sustainably harvested eucalyptus, walnut, or oak trim. “Our materials are not overtly opulent but are high quality,” Jenkins says. “It’s a ‘post-luxury’ aesthetic that comes from contemporary fashion and architecture.”</p>
		<p>Perhaps most important, it bests the current Teslas by far with the aforementioned roughly 500-mile range. Eric Bach, Lucid’s vice president of hardware and engineering, provided AD a tour of the Air’s technology, which is rooted in the company’s history-creating batteries and drivetrains for Formula E electric race cars. “Our innovation is taking ultra-high voltage to our battery and charging technology,” Bach says, “and working to minimize heat, power losses, resistance, and weight. This allows us to get more miles per kilowatt-hour of battery. We believe this is the transformative metric.”</p>
		<p>Lucid has already opened “studios” in key EV markets in the Northeast and the West Coast, where potential consumers can inspect, spec, and order a vehicle. The Base model, with one motor in the rear, will make 480 hp, have 406 miles of range, and cost $77,400 before federal, state, and local EV tax rebates. The $87,500 Touring model adds a second motor up front, all-wheel drive, and 170 additional hp but retains the 406-mile range. The $139,000 Grand Touring model makes 800 hp and has 517 miles of range. And the $169,000 Dream Edition has 1080 hp but a slightly lower 506-mile range.</p>
		<p>Given the large capacity of its battery pack, Bach suggests that the Air could even be used as an energy sink, charged up to full capacity during off-peak hours when juice is cheaper, and then used to power your house during the day. “Or, if your friend’s electric car runs out of charge—not naming any names,” Bach says, smiling, “—you can use it to charge another EV.”</p>
