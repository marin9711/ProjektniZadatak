        <h2>Porsche Further Increases Stake In Rimac Automobili To 24%</h2>
        <p class="description">The rumors about Porsche's further investment in Rimac Automobili were true, as the German manufacturer just triggered its third round of €70 million ($83 million).</p>
        <p>Porsche's stake is now at 24%, up from 15.5% in 2019, and 10% in 2018. If that additional 8.5 % was worth €70 million, then the market value of the company must be estimated above €820 million. Three investment rounds from Porsche alone is clear proof that the company is on the right track.</p>
        <p>According to the press release, Rimac Automobili has nearly 1,000 employees (nearly doubled the number since 2018), and works with many major car manufacturers, including Hyundai, Kia, Porsche, Aston Martin, Automobili Pininfarina, Koenigsegg and "many more". The main focus and specialization is on advanced electrified powertrains, batteries, infotainment and "other components related to electrification."</p>
        <p>Well, Rimac Automobili without a doubt is one of the biggest success stories of a company that went from the garage to global within just 10 years. We are eager to see not only Rimac Automobili's technology but also its in-house new EVs, like the upcoming second-generation electric hypercar, codenamed C_Two.</p>
